            <h2>Education<span class="progress">In progress</span></h2>
            <p>I finished school with strong GCSE results and went on to study A-levels.</p>
            <p>At college I took part in the youth enterprise scheme where I was nominated as IT director and was responsible for creating the company website. The enterprise was a success, with us achieving the accreditation.</p>
            <p>I am still in part-time education with the Open University where I have been studying for a <strong>Bachelor's degree in IT &amp; Computing with a focus on software development</strong> since 2014.</p>

            <h2>Junior Web Developer<span>2007-2008</span><span class="complete">Complete</span></h2>
            <p>After school I attained a job as a junior web developer for Specnet Ltd, a small web design company located in Earl Shilton. I joined a husband and wife team who had various local clients.</p>
            <p>My main responsibilities were;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minor HTML changes on client request</li>
                <li>Developing new features</li>
                <li>Aiding the main developer with implementation</li>
                <li>Maintaining web hosting accounts</li>
                <li>Uploading websites to hosting</li>
                <li>Populating SEO meta data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This was a rewarding role where I really got to cut my teeth on real-world web development. My greatest achievements at the time were implementing a search feature for the Small Business Forum website and creating all the graphics for a local car garage website.</p>

            <h2>Trainee Game Developer<span>2008-2009</span><span class="complete">Complete</span></h2>
            <p>During the 2008 recession I took back to studying, this time looking to game development. I joined the Train2Game developer program which used a study from home model.</p>
            <p>This program taught me a large amount about programming in C++, libraries, using graphics engines, spriting and a lot of lower level functionality that is usually abstracted from higher level development.</p>
            <p>I was introduced to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pathing algorithms (Dijkstra, A*)</li>
                <li>Graphics engines (DirectDraw)</li>
                <li>Game loops</li>
                <li>Bitwise operations</li>
                <li>Memory management</li>
                <li>Threading</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This course bought a much deeper understanding of how programs work and my most-lasting takeaway was of Object Oriented programming (OOP).</p>
